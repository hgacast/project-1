Project 1: Brand Website

Description
Every small business has its own storefront, whether it be physical or virtual. Storefronts provide an entry point for a customer to do business with you. Up to this point you have been designing for physical spaces and products. For this project, you will learn to expand a brand into a website.

Imagine a fictional business which summarizes the company's mission, values, and products/services. You will lightly brand the company, then develop a website based on the needs and requirements of the business and its customers. You will be expected to do research on similar products/services, take any necessary photos, and provide customers with an experience that reflects the company's philosophy. This project emphasizes navigation, structure, design and html/css as the main components.

 

Deliveries
Create a folder called â€œproject-1â€ one html file per page and with sub folders for "images" and "css" (Style the pages using a single separate CSS external file). Test your pages along the way.

When it looks finalized, final website must be functional on both Firefox and Chrome. 

Create a repository on github, then send delivery email (see "communication protocole") with the link of the repo inside email.


Prototype
Your project grade is ultimately based on the final working prototype of your responsive website. You will be building the websites using HTML5/CSS3 in the â€œcodeâ€ mode of a chosen text editor.
